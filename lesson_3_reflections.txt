-1-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping
all your work local?

You would want to use a remote repository when the project could use
a few contributors, as an access point for multipile devices, or to
share with others.


-2-Why might you whant to always pull changes manually rather than
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Changes made by others will cause Git to automatically update your
project and leave no room for review and approval. Additionally, you
would not know any changes occured, unless notified.


-3-Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When
would you use one instead of another?

Forks are remotley copied repositories, such as GitHub, and are to be
used when you want to modify a project owned by another and have it
availble online. clones are repositories copied to a local computer.
They are used when you want to have a copy for personal modifications
or use. Branches are alternate paths a project takes by following a
different set of commits. They are for experimenting on a project.
