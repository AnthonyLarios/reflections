-1-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping
all your work local?

You would want to use a remote repository when the project could use
a few contributors, as an access point for multipile devices, or to
share with others.


-2-Why might you whant to always pull changes manually rather than
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Changes made by others will cause Git to automatically update your
project and leave no room for review and approval. Additionally, you
would not know any changes occured, unless notified.
