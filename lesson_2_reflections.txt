--What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do 
you need to do it?

You create a .git folder when you initialize a 
repository, which allows you to make commits into it.



--How is the staging area different from the working 
area and the reppository? What value do you think it 
offers?

The staging area is the middle man for how you want to 
add files into git. You can create logical commits with
the staging area.



--How can you use the staging area to make sure you have 
one commit per logical change?

You can see what is ready for commit and make sure that
the desired files are in the staging area and reflect 
the logical change.
